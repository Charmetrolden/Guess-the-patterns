**Guess The Patterns**
What pattern is used?

You are given three files (PatternA, PatternB, and PatternC) which each implement a different design pattern.

Your task is to determine what pattern is used.

**Solution**
Each pattern file will have a comment block to write your answer and comments.

If you see /* Write your answers and comments below this line */ you have found the right place

**What you will be evaluated on**
You will be evaluated on your ability to determine what pattern is used and explain its pros and cons. Total points can be only be awarded if you explain which problems the pattern can solve and the pros and cons of the pattern.
